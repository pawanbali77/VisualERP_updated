                    <h2>Communications</h2>
                    <br /><br />
                    <p>By creating an Account on our service, you agree to subscribe to newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information we may send.

                    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
                    <br /><br />
                    <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a monthly basis.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or GroEngine, Inc. cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting GroEngine, Inc. customer support team.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide GroEngine, Inc. with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize GroEngine, Inc. to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, GroEngine, Inc. will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
                    <br /><br />

                    <p>GroEngine, Inc., in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>GroEngine, Inc. will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
